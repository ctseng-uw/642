1. BadgerCam
    - Vulnerabilities
    - Steps
    - Mitigation


2. Router
    - Vulnerabilities
    - Steps
    - Mitigation


3. BadgerSpeaker
    - Vulnerabilities
        - The device has an API that does not need any kind of authorization
    - Steps
        - Set up port forwarding in the router
        - Send an audio file (that says "turn on the microwave") via API
        - `curl -d "url={url to flac}" -X POST [speaker ip]:[port] --socks5 localhost:1080`
    - Mitigation
        - Implement username/password or other authorization methods on the API


4. BadgerVoice
    - Vulnerabilities
        - The device responds to any voice command
        - The device expose voice commands to the web so the attacker can know if their attack works or not
        - Place just beside a network-enabled speaker
    - Steps
        - As soon as we send the audio file to BadgerSpeaker, this device re   sponds and start the microwave
    - Mitigation
        - Use a voice model so that the device will only respond to the owner's voice
        - Do not expose log on the web
        - Do not place beside a smart speaker


5. Microwave
    - Vulnerabilities
        - It is connected to a vulnerable digital assistant
    - Steps
        - This device is compromised the moment we compromise BadgerSpeaker and BadgerVoice
    - Mitigation
        - Do not connect to a vulnerable digital assistant
        - Swap this microwave to another one that will not cause fire just by turning it on
