1. BadgerCam
    - Vulnerabilities
        - searchable on Nidan + username/password combo preset
    - Steps
        - search on Nidan search engine by the name
        - get the website to get in the BadgerCam (http://[2607:f388:1080:0700:bb84:380e:1e2d:5710]:8001)
        - try every username/password pair to get in ("admin", "123456")
    - Mitigation
        - make it unsearchable from the IOT search engine if possible 
        - do not use easily-guessed/frequently-used username and/or password 
        - do not store the password anywhere

2. Router
    - Vulnerabilities
        - searchable on Nidan + username/password showing in the BadgerCam
    - Steps
        - search on Nidan by the same organization as BadgerCam
        - get the router's website by search engine(http://[2607:f388:1080:0700:bb84:380e:1e2d:5710]:8004)
        - login by the username/password pair showing on BadgerCam's monitor("admin","husk1e$are@wesome!!")
    - Mitigation
        - make it unsearchable from the IOT search engine if possible
        - do not show the password in any public places


3. BadgerSpeaker
    - Vulnerabilities
        - The device has an API that does not need any kind of authorization
    - Steps
        - Set up port forwarding in the router
        - Send an audio file (that says "turn on the microwave") via API
        - `curl -d "url={url to flac}" -X POST [speaker ip]:[port] --socks5 localhost:1080`
    - Mitigation
        - Implement username/password or other authorization methods on the API


4. BadgerVoice
    - Vulnerabilities
        - The device responds to any voice command
        - The device expose voice commands to the web so the attacker can know if their attack works or not
        - Place just beside a network-enabled speaker
    - Steps
        - As soon as we send the audio file to BadgerSpeaker, this device re   sponds and start the microwave
    - Mitigation
        - Use a voice model so that the device will only respond to the owner's voice
        - Do not expose log on the web
        - Do not place beside a smart speaker


5. Microwave
    - Vulnerabilities
        - It is connected to a vulnerable digital assistant
    - Steps
        - This device is compromised the moment we compromise BadgerSpeaker and BadgerVoice
    - Mitigation
        - Do not connect to a vulnerable digital assistant
        - Swap this microwave to another one that will not cause fire just by turning it on
