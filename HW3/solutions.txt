# Trace 3: Traceroute
## Briefly describe how the traceroute tool works including which network protocols are in use.

Traceroute tool is to discover the routers between source and destination. To get this information, it needs UDP and ICMP.
The client will send out packet with UDP and set up TTL to 1 initially. After the packet reaches first router, the TTL will become 0(1-1=0), therefore it will send the message back to the source with ICMP protocol.
Then, because the client receives the error message saying TTL exceeding, it knows the packet did not reach destination. The client then sends out the packet again with UDP and adds TTL by 1. If the packet does not reach destination, it will send back TTL exceed again from the router it reached(This time is the second router).
This will continue until the ICMP message becomes "destination unreachable" which indicates the packet arrives the destination.
And, we can get the routers' IP address in between source and destination by the ICMP message(by the source IP address in each ICMP part).

## Give the source IP address that issued the traceroute command and the destination IP address.

source IP address: 192.168.0.100
destination IP address: 74.125.225.46

## List the IP addresses on the route between source and destination.
