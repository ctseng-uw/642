Explanation

The program contains unsafe use of `strcpy`, therefore we can overwrite eip to hijack control flow.

The format of the attack string is
[32 0s][0xbffff888][0x0804851d]
1. [32 0s]: This part contains 32 0s to fill up the legitimate space of `buf`
2. [0xbffff888]: This is whatever the program stored in the saved EBP section (Discovered via GDB)
3. [0x0804851d]: This is an address that points to the code `grade='A'`

When the code return from `check_fail`, it will resume execution from the line `grade='A'` causes it to print `Grade = A`.
